# Future Features and To-Do List

This document outlines the planned features and to-do list for our agent, inspired by the augment-swebench-agent.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Enhanced Command Execution
- **Description:** Implement a secure bash command execution tool with an approval mechanism to prevent accidental execution of harmful commands.
- **Priority:** High

### 2. File Manipulation Tool
- **Description:** Create a unified tool for viewing and editing files, allowing the agent to interact with the codebase seamlessly.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Priority:** High

### 3. Sequential Thinking and Planning
- **Description:** Introduce a planning module that enables the agent to break down complex problems into a sequence of smaller, actionable steps. This will involve creating a sequential agent that can maintain a state and execute a series of tools to solve a problem.
- **Priority:** High

### 4. Modular Tool Integration
- **Description:** Design a flexible architecture that allows for easy integration of new tools and models, making the agent more extensible.
- **Priority:** Medium

## Future To-Do List
- [ ] Implement the enhanced command execution tool.
- [x] Develop the file manipulation tool.
- [x] Build the sequential thinking and planning module.
- [ ] Design and implement the modular tool integration system.
- [ ] Integrate with additional models like OpenAI's o1 for ensembling.
- [ ] Develop a majority vote ensembler for selecting the best solution.
- [ ] Add support for running the agent in a Docker container.
